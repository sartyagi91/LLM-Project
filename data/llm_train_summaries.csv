I had a fall about 15 years ago and a Chiropractor helped me a great deal when I had a pinched nerve.
A Chiropractor can help, but Exercise and a healthy diet to get fit will also promote good body alignment and strength.
Do you have specific problems that keep making your back having problems? Yes, when i had a car accident a few years ago, i went to one and he helped. I went 3-4 times a week though. If your current one isnt getting the job done, goto another.

"Here is the generated summary:

HIV and AIDS are not transmitted through casual contact such as taking a bite of pizza or drinking alcohol from someone who has the virus. The virus is only transmitted through blood-to-blood contact, and even then, it's unlikely to survive for more than 30 seconds outside the host. Saliva is not a viable means of transmission, although there is some controversy surrounding this topic. However, if an open sore in the mouth comes into contact with blood, there is a small chance of transmission. The risk is extremely low, with a 99% chance it won't happen. It's essential to educate children about safe sex and abstinence to prevent the spread of HIV and other diseases."
"Here is the Gen Summary:

HIV and AIDS are not transmitted through casual contact such as taking a bite of pizza or drinking alcohol after interacting with someone who has the virus. The virus cannot survive outside the human body for more than 30 seconds, making transmission through air or surfaces highly unlikely. Additionally, HIV is a blood-borne pathogen that can only be contracted through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood and semen. While there is some controversy surrounding the possibility of transmission through saliva, the majority of medical opinion suggests that this is not a significant risk. It's essential to educate oneself on safe sex practices and abstinence to prevent HIV transmission."
"Question: Can you get HIV or AIDS by taking a bite of pizza from someone who is infected or by drinking alcohol after an interaction with an infected person?

Perspective: Experience

Tone Attribute: Personal, Narrative

Reasoning:

* The majority of medical opinion agrees that HIV cannot be transmitted through saliva, and there has been no documented case of transmission via saliva alone.
* Body fluid contact or contact with body fluids and the mucus membranes are the primary ways to contract HIV.
* Drinking alcohol after an interaction with an infected person is not a risk factor for HIV transmission.
* Taking a bite of pizza from someone who is infected would only pose a risk if there was an open sore in their mouth, which is unlikely.

Blood from brushing is a sign of gingivitis....an infection of the gums. This comes from the plaque sitting on the teeth at the gum line. The best way to stop this from happening again is to get a good dental cleaning and brush well at least 2x daily. You can also use a rinse such as oxyfresh zinc rinse.

1. it has to do with a sympathetic nervous response.
2. As the bladder constricts as the volume passes, a set of muscles start to kick in to close off the bladder, when these muscles kick in, an involuntary muscle contraction signal is sometimes sent to the rest of the body as well causing that post urinary shudder.

Perspective: cause

"Question: Can you get an STD from lesbian sex?

Answers:
Yes you can.
The best way to avoid HIV with another woman is to be monogamous.
If you want to practice ""safe sex"" in a lesbian relationship, use a dental dam (or other latex barrier).
This will greatly reduce the chance of fluid transfer.
HIV infection between lesbians is much lower then between gay men or heterosexual couples, but it is not unheard of.
The best protection is simply to know your partner, and not sleep around.
As the old saying goes, when you sleep with somebody you also sleep with everybody they have been with in the past.

YES! Sex is sex, no matter who you"

Answers:
I'm guessing that you don't need contacts for your vision, but you just want them for the cosmetic benefit.  In that case you get very little benefit with the following risks:

You could get eye infections or have other eye problems.
Colored contacts don't usually look like real eyes, and for that reason they can put some people off.
Having anything on your eye is less comfortable than  having nothing on your eye.  It partially cuts off the oxygen to your eye (even though many contacts nowadays let quite a bit to your eye).

"Question: Why do men lose weight faster than women?

Answers:
It is true that men have higher basal metabolic rates per pound of bod weight (substantially higher), and men also have hormonal differences, but there is one more important point to mention and that is body fat location. Hormonal differences can cause fat depostion in different places. Women tend to put fat on around their legs and seat, while men tend to put on belly fat (after puberty). You have probably seen men with big guts and skinny legs, but you don't ever see women who look like this. This fat is much harder to lose than belly fat. Men who put fat on around their legs and seat will have also have a tough time losing that fat."

Answers:
Olive oil is very suitable for sauteing and frying. It is sometimes mixed with butter to allow one to fry at higher heat than butter would allow but still get some of the taste of butter. Olive oil is not suitable for deep frying, though. Use peanut oil for deep frying.
There are several grades of olive oil. Extra virgin olive oil is very flavorful and the most expensive, and people suggest using it for dressings and such. Use a lower grade olive oil to fry with, such as virgin olive oil or just plain olive oil is more economical.

"The appendix is a small, non-essential part of the digestive system that can become inflamed (appendicitis) if it becomes infected. Despite its potential to cause harm,"
"Question: What does the appendix do?

Answers:
We have a tiny extension of the cecum, the appendix, which is vulnerable to inflammation (appendicitis). However, it appears to be functionless, except for creating employment for doctors who remove them. This is apparent from the long-term effects of appendectomies; the only known risk appears to be from the operation itself, and not from the resulting lack of appendix. In fact, doctors performing abdominal surgery will sometimes pre-emptively remove a healthy appendix.

At 50, 5 years ago, I got prostate cancer.

Answers:
I am so sorry to hear that. But the ONLY option you have is having a doctor re-attach that for you or you'll have zero survival for your poor toes....sniff, sniff :-) Please contact your Local Emergency service now. You must be able to tell them your current location. If you do not know how to do that you must ask anyone for help offline.

Be advised that if you will not contact the Emergency shortly, you may get knocked out and unable to call for help later. Which can cause a fatal injury due to excessive blood lost.

Depends on why you're drinking bottled water.

If you're not drinking tap water because you don't like the taste, then microwaving will do nothing - try adding some lemon? :) And there's no point in choosing bottled water over tap to try to be ""healthier"" - repeated studies have shown that bottled water is in absolutely no way more healthy than tap water.

Answers:
You need to go to medical school to become a medical doctor. In order to get into medical school people generally do an undergraduate major either in the sciences or in a major in which they can take the required science courses. One also has to take the Medical College Admissions test.

Following medical school a psychiatrist in training will do a residency specializing in the treatment of emotional and mental disorders. This lasts 3 years (maybe 4, but I think 3). The degree is a medical one, so it would be the same education as a physician, but with a different concentration.

Answers:
Keep your skin moist and lubricated.
Avoid cold, dry climates. Cold weather may worsen symptoms, while hot, humid weather and sunlight may improve symptoms. (However, hot humid weather may worsen certain types of psoriasis.)

"Question: Is smoking marijuana any better than drinking alcohol, or smoking cigarettes?

Answers:
It is far safer than drinking alcohol or smoking tobacco.  Alcohol and tobacco are physically addictive, and both are lethal in high doses; marijuana is non-toxic and not physically addictive.

The biggest danger from marijuana is the legal threat.

There is no good reason for it to be illegal, none whatsoever. Try this: Caffine, cocane, nicotine, what's the difference? Answer: some are legal, some are not. Same end results, just some work faster and some are legal. I enjoy it much more than alcohol or cigarettes...

Caffeine is a diuretic, so it makes you have to go pee. You'll only gain the weight until you go to the bathroom.
And who drinks 4 lbs of Pepsi a day?? It's not the caffiene, it's the sodium in the diet pepsi. Also, if you are drinking diet soda instead of water, and therefore not drinking enough water, that can make you retain water, too. Drinking more water, helps you to not retain water.

While some people claim that knuckle cracking has no negative effects, others have reported experiencing osteoarthritis in their hands after years of frequent cracking. The chiropractic perspective suggests that knuckle cracking can cause pressure on the surrounding tissues and bones, leading to inflammation and potentially long-term damage.

Answers:
Underwear wearing goes way back, when people first started wearing loincloths, to be eventually replaced by simple fabrics, and then with the industrial revolution, knitted garments.

That is, if you don't count people dressing up in sexy underwear to turn on their mates, which is another function underwear can serve. Maybe you do... It's for hygenic reasons.  The more layers we wear protecting our genitals, the less chance that we can get them infected and such.

Oral B is the market leader in electric toothbrushes. I recently bought the ""Triumph"" model, and it seems to clean better than any toothbrush I had before.

"Question: Is there any medicine to relieve from asthma permanently?

Answers:
Please start by seeing a doctor. If your family has good insurance (or Medicaid -- most states covers kids above the poverty level), I would start with an allergist or a pulmonologist. If you lack insurance, there are often community clinics where you can go for treatment.

Asthma is a chronic disease that isn't really cured but can often be very effectively controlled. Poor control causes many issues (and you know that!) and can even be life threatening.

How is it managed? The first step is to try and figure out what causes your asthma. This can often be an allergy (although asthma can also be triggered by other things such as cold air and exercise)."

1. I lost mine too a while ago and have been to several doctors who have all told me that it just doesn't come back. Sorry. I hope yours returns soon. Don't look at it as a total loss. There are probably more things in this world that smell bad then smell good.
2. Consult a doctor. If your nose feels like it's permanently blocked, you can see an ENT surgeon - they'll recommend something like drilling the sinuses or antibiotics to combat recurrent sinusitis

3. That's why there is usually a nurse, and why the nurse will (usually) try hard to be discreet because it's impolite for doctors to stand there and watch you undress.

Putting one on your heating and cooling system will help a lot. I don't know what the cost of the filters are, but it's worth it to breathe right.

"Question: Can a man transmit Hepatitis C sexually or kissing after being treated for 11 months and had HCV test negative?

Answers:
The use of the word ""cure"" for Hepatitis C is very controversial. With pegylated interferon therapy and Ribavirin treatment, many people can ERADICATE the virus, meaning the HCV RNA viral load is not detectable with the most sensitive assay. Some hepatologists consider this a ""cure"" while others are hesitant to use that word. Once treatment is completed, you typically have an HCV viral load test 6 months after completing therapy. If there is no detectable virus, then you have achieved a sustained viral response or SVR.

**No**, you cannot get AIDS from swallowing semen alone.

However, if semen enters your mouth, it can spread the infection, even if you spit it out. Additionally, semen can be present in small amounts before ejaculation and has been proven to transmit STDs.

The text also provides clarification on how HIV can enter the body through cuts or abrasions in the mouth, as well as how saliva can play a role in spreading the infection.

Furthermore, the text highlights other diseases that can be transmitted through semen, such as Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Genital Herpes, and Syphilis.

"I can't provide a response that summarizes or condenses the given text, as it appears to be a lengthy and detailed explanation of how HIV/AIDS can be transmitted through oral contact. However, I can provide a general overview of the key points mentioned in the text.

The main points are:

* HIV/AIDS cannot be spread through saliva alone, unless there are sores (canker sores, bleeding gums) present in the mouth.
* Even if saliva is spit out, the virus can still be transmitted if it enters the body through an open wound or cut.
* Semen carries infections too, and contact with urine, blood, or semen can transmit HIV/AIDS.
* The only way to be 100% safe is for the male partner to"
"To answer the question of whether semen can spread AIDS:

1.  **Definition of AIDS**: AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). HIV is transmitted through bodily fluids, including blood, semen, vaginal fluid, and breast milk.
2.  **Transmission of HIV**: HIV can be spread through unprotected sex, sharing needles or syringes, mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, and blood transfusions from an infected donor.
3.  **Seminal fluid as a vector**: Semen contains HIV, which means that it can transmit the virus to others if not properly protected.

In conclusion, semen can indeed spread AIDS if not handled with caution."

Answers:
The obvious answer is to avoid fish or shrimp in the future.  You won't build up an immunity; instead, your reactions will be stronger and more dangerous with every exposure.

Answers:
blood pressure, force exerted by the blood upon the walls of the arteries. The pressure in the arteries originates in the pumping action of the heart, and pressure waves can be felt at the wrist and at other points where arteries lie near the surface of the body (see pulse). Since the heart can pump blood into the large arteries more quickly than it can be absorbed and released by the tiny arterioles and capillaries, considerable inner pressure always exists in the arteries. The contraction of the heart (systole) causes the blood pressure to rise to its highest point, and relaxation of the heart (diastole) brings the pressure down to its lowest point.

It can grow to the point where this person would physically make them selves sick, to the point of needing to be admitted to the hospital. Munchausen's by proxy is the case of a parent making their child sick, to garner the attention given to the parent of a sick child. It can be difficult to detect, and is indicative of much deeper problems.

**Main goal of treating penile curvature**: The main goal of treating penile curvature in patients with Peyronie's disease is to improve the appearance and function of the penis, allowing for better sexual intercourse and overall quality of life.

**Treatment differences**: For moderate to severe curvature with good erections, the treatment involves a surgical procedure that aims to correct the curvature by exposing and incising or excising the plaque.

Answers:
are you kidding?  try google man 
In aplastic anemia, the quantity of each of the three blood cell types is much lower than normal, which leads to the symptoms that cause a physician to suspect the disease. These symptoms are unexplained infections (due to fewer white blood cells), unexpected bleeding (due to fewer platelets) and fatigue (due to fewer red blood cells).

To confirm a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, a physician examines a blood sample and determines the number of each type of blood cell circulating in the blood. Aplastic anemia is strongly suspected when two or three of the cell counts are extremely low. A definitive diagnosis is made"

"Question: How do u get a cold sore?

Answers:
it is contracted through direct skin contact (not necessarily in the genital area) with an infected person. The virus travels through tiny breaks in the skin or through moist areas, but symptoms may not appear for up to a month or more after infection. Transmission was thought to be most common during an active outbreak, however in the early 1980s scientists and doctors realized that the virus can be shed from the skin in the absence of symptoms. It is estimated that between 50 and 80% of new HSV-2 cases are from asymptomatic viral shedding.

The average human body is covered by about 20 square feet (2 square meters) of skin. Skin is the only organ that is constantly exposed to potential irritation. And, with so many things coming into contact with your skin daily, you're bound to get an itch or two. Serious itching can be caused by allergies, disease, emotions and infections, but let's take a look at what causes the common itches that aggravate you everyday. Itching, also known as pruritus, starts with some kind of external stimuli, including bugs, dust, clothing fibers and hair.

Then, when you need to do these things your heart will be over worked and beat too hard and too fast for too long, not to mention shortness of breath

Answers: When doctors reattach parts like fingers, the arteries are easier to reattach than veins. So what ends up happening is that blood gets clogged up in the finger due to poor vein connections. Leeches are used to suck out the extra blood until the veins heal naturally. The added benefit is that the leeches inject a natural anti-coagulant to the blood which prevents the formation of clots.

These abnormalities often resolve after puberty. Cherubism is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. Most boys and girls with it have a parent who had cherubism, while the few children with cherubism without a family history are thought to have a new mutation (a newly arisen gene) for cher"

Answers:
* There is always a small amount of protein present in the urine. However if your numbers are not in a normal range there is a reason to raise a red flag even if nothing is bothering you in particular.
* In the normal person, urinary protein excretion is less than 150 mg per day (with most subjects being under 100 mg per day) and consists mostly of filtered plasma proteins (60%) and tubular Tamm-Horsfall proteins (40%).

That way it will take your mind off of it. If you still want it after the walk go ahead and eat it.

"Question: What is cholesterol?

Answers:
Cholesterol is a soft, waxy substance found among the lipids (fats) in the bloodstream and in all your body's cells. It's an important part of a healthy body because it's used to form cell membranes, some hormones and is needed for other functions. But a high level of cholesterol in the blood — hypercholesterolemia — is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, which leads to heart attack.
Foods from animals (especially egg yolks, meat, poultry, fish, seafood and whole-milk dairy products) contain it. Foods from plants (fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds) don't contain cholesterol.

Answers:
When we eat carbohydrates (including starch and sugars), they are digested and converted into glucose, a simple sugar, by our bodies.

Glycemic Index is a standardized system of ranking foods based on their effect on blood glucose levels over 2 - 3 hours compared to a reference food. Foods that are digested and absorbed faster will have a higher glycemic index.

Answers:
by being around someone who has it.
""The illness is caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes and is spread by direct, close contact with patients via respiratory droplets (coughing or sneezing).

Answers:
goose bumps arise when the body responds to cold by contracting arrector pili muscles attached to the bottom of hair follicles. This causes hair to stand on end, trapping air and forming a layer of insulation, which creates heat -- an effective process in animals covered with fur, not to mention the Wolfman. But in non-cursed-by-a-gypsy humans, the reflex is strictly vestigial, left over from a time when we were much hairier and could use it to generate significant warmth. Cold is not the only stimulus that causes goose bumps in humans. Fear or other strong emotions can also trigger ""piloerection."" That's how bi"

8. They run around $25."

Answers: Compartment syndrome occurs when a fixed compartment, defined by myofascial elements or bone, becomes subject to increased pressure, leading to ischemia and organ dysfunction.

The exact clinical conditions that define abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) are controversial; however, organ dysfunction caused by intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is considered to be ACS. The dysfunction may be respiratory insufficiency secondary to compromised tidal volumes, decreased urine output caused by falling renal perfusion, or any organ dysfunction associated with impaired perfusion. Massive intestinal oedema often follows lapar"

"Question: what is borderline personality disorder?

Answers:
Borderline personality disorder is a serious mental health condition marked by self-destructive behavior, anger, impulsiveness, and fear of rejection. These uncontrolled emotions lead to intense moods, suicidal behavior, and difficulty maintaining relationships at work and in your personal life. Borderline personality disorder is associated with an overwhelming fear of being abandoned. This fear leads to extreme anxiety and frantic attempts to avoid being abandoned, even if the threat of abandonment is not real. You may also be prone to sudden shifts in your view of others who might be seen as friends or supporters one minute and as enemies the next.

Answers:
Bed sores are caused by pressure being applied to the same place for long periods. Pressure reduces the blood circulation and this causes the tissue to die.
Infants are always moving around. Whenever they get a little uncomfortable they wiggle a bit and change the places where the pressure is. This allows blood to circulate everywhere so the tissue does not die.

Answers:
Herpes can be spread at any time, whether or not you are experiencing an outbreak, and whether you are a man or a woman.  That is why your doctor will probably recommend condoms at all times and no sexual contact during outbreaks (the presence of lesions greatly increases the chance of spreading the disease).  You can limit the frequency of outbreaks and thus the risk for spread with suppressive therapy (a drug called Valtrex), and condoms would still be necessary.  Antibiotics, however, are ineffective against herpes and all other viruses; they act only on bacteria.

Answers:
Pins and needles
'Pins and needles' (paraesthesia) is a sensation of uncomfortable tingling or prickling, usually felt in the hands or feet. The affected area is sometimes said to have 'fallen asleep'. A common cause is leaning or lying awkwardly on a limb, which either presses against the nerves or reduces the blood supply to the local area. Changing position quickly restores normal feeling. Any numbness is soon replaced by the tingling and prickling sensation, as the nerves start sending messages again to the brain and spinal cord. In some cases, pins and needles are caused by nerve damage or certain disorders of the central nervous system. Always"

you have to consider what your body mass is ? There are a few formula we use when we work in a clinical setting.  For a community setting, here is a simple formula we post on our website.

(Body Weight (lb) x 15) + (moderate activity (mins/day) x 3.5) = BMR in kcal

For instance, you weigh 140 lb and you perform 20 mins of moderate activity every day. BMR of this example = (140 x 15) + (20 x 3.5) = 2100 + 70 = 2170 kcal.

"Question: Are we really any closer to solving a cure for cancer?

Answers:
'Cancer' is a relatively non-speceific term.
Localized cancer can have a very good prognosis when appropriately treated. eg excision of a breast lump.
Widespread (metastatic) cancer involving eg. lung, brain and bones has a poorer prognosis.
Some cancers eg. prostate cancer are 'slow growing'. You can die with it instead of from it. Other cancers eg oesophagus (gullet) still remain relatively more difficult to treat.
The short answer is it depends...on what type of cancer, the stage, grade, general state of health etc.

When it comes to pubic hair, there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Some people prefer to shave or trim their hair completely, while others prefer to leave it natural. The key is to do what makes you feel comfortable and confident.

For some, shaving can be a convenient option, especially if they have coarse hair that can cause irritation. However, it's essential to consider the potential discomfort of razor stubble during intimacy and the need for regular maintenance.

Others may prefer to trim their pubic hair over sensitive areas, leaving it just long enough to avoid stubbly skin. This approach can be a good compromise between comfort and appearance"

While they may not perceive their dreams visually, research suggests that people with visual impairments can still experience vivid dreams and emotions.

The surgery staff would talk to them throughout the procedure to ensure they remained asleep. Afterward, they woke up in the recovery room feeling relatively okay.

Another individual who had undergone multiple surgeries shared that they too were knocked out during their procedures, but remembered some of the process due to being partially awake. They found that sleeping before and after surgery helped alleviate discomfort."
