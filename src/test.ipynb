If you can, get your hands on some muscle relaxants, like Vicodin. advil This may sound gross but sex sex sex!! It releases hormones that are natural painkillers. Also try chocolate that may help it does the same thing sex does. Tampons also can make cramps worse so maybe for the first day or so when your flow is heaviest wear a pad.

What should I do?\", 'answers': \"Persistent fatigue which is not alleviated by sleep is a characteristic of many chronic conditions. Debilitating fatigue can also occur without an obvious illness and, after six months, is classified as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Milder forms have been dubbed ‘TATT’ (tired all the time).\\n\\nFatigue can often be traced back to a viral infection, but this may not be the only culprit. It usually results from a combination of several factors, such as poor diet, overwork, a viral or bacterial infection, bereavement, stress, physical exhaustion, exposure to toxins etc. Its does not respond readily to modern drugs, so many sufferers turn towards alternative and complementary medicine in their quest for a solution.\\n\\nThe treatment strategy which has worked with my patients is to close all possible avenues where diet or lifestyle may be inadequate by using a multi-dimensional approach. This means making an effort to ensure an above-average nutrient-intake by eating a healthy diet coupled with taking a range of good-quality supplements. In addition, I prescribe herbal medicine with immune-stimulating properties. \\n\\nNutrition\\n\\nIt is especially important for people with fatigue to choose a healthy diet. However, even when eating in this way, a person with fatigue may not reach daily nutrient-intake targets because of poor absorption and poor appetite due to lack of exercise. Hence, nutrient supplementation is an important, essential strategy to augment a healthy diet. A supplement programme for fatigue should start with a basic ‘multi’. This will provide most of the vitamins and minerals needed by the body at essential requirement levels. However, it will not contain enough calcium and magnesium, because these are required in much higher quantities than will fit into a single ‘multi’. Extra calcium will be required if fewer than three portions of dairy products are eaten per day. More magnesium is required if the intake of wholegrains, nuts, beans and seeds is low. (In fact, magnesium deficiency is very common in fatigue.) It is best to take these two minerals together in a good bone formula in the ratio of 2:1 calcium to magnesium\\n\\nA group of symptoms often accompanying fatigue is related to inflammation. This shows up as catarrh, skin rash, dry skin or eadaches. There are two approaches to reduce inflammation: increasing intake of (a) antioxidants and (b) omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. Therefore, extra vitamin C is likely to be useful. For optimal nutrition, take at least 500mg daily as a supplement which, again, is much higher than will go into a single ‘multi’ tablet. \\n\\nI have written about the importance of getting the right balance of essential fatty acids in a previous Healthspan magazine.5 For fatigue sufferers, as well as having anti-inflammatory properties, it is the direct benefit that omega-3 fatty acids have on boosting normal immune function that is particularly important.\\n\\nHerbs\\n\\nFor those with CFS, herbal medicine seems to have a very special role in normalising the immune system, which cannot be effected by essential nutrients alone. In fact, the more severe and persistent the fatigue, the more important it seems to be to augment the nutritional approach above with immune-supportive herbs. Since herbal treatments for CFS have to be individually prescribed, a visit to a professional is necessary. Contact the College of Practitioners (01424 776780) or the National Institute of Medical Herbalists (01392 426022) to find a registered herbal practitioner in your area. Herbal prescriptions normally include those with outspoken traditional use for supporting the immune and nervous systems. St John’s Wort is particularly useful, since it appears to act in both domains. Echinacea, which can be used to help overcome exposure to viruses and to reduce the number of relapses, does not raise vitality in the same way. Other vitality-raising herbs for immune support include astragalus, ashwaganda This could be health related. Diabetics normally feel tired most of the time. Please check with your doctor, it could be depression too. It could be a million different things from \\nMono, (Epstein-barr syndrome) or another term for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  Post viral fatigue syndrome, etc..\\nhttp://health.yahoo.com/ency/healthwise/hw168620\\n\\nCould be so many things. Vitamin deficiency for instance.  \\n\\nSee a doctor and have some basic bloodwork done, if you are not feeling better.\\n\\nYou CANNOT expect to get good advice from the people on ANSWERS. Even if a doctor answers your question, he is not intimate with your medical history, or you (on a professional level). \\n\\nFor example, I gave only one or two  possiblities.  \\n\\nSee a doctor, and find out for sure.  Why take chances with your body and life, asking questions here???\\n\\nI could give you the long answer you might find here, but realistically , you know your own body, and you need to make a decision to take your symptoms in hand.

PLEASE PLEASE pay attention to what your body is telling u. ALWAYS REMEMER THE SUN WILL COME OUT! Maybe not tomorrow but it will be back. When we are down it is very hard to remember that.....but if u hurt yourself there will never be a tomorrow. Talk to a counselor at school.  Tell them how you feel and ask them for help.

Call the doctor! I would go to your mom and let her know that maybe it could be physical but either way you would like to find out, I would explain to the doctor how you have been feeling and that you are conserned that it is all tied in to depression, if your mom still isn't hearing you and won't take you to the doctors, how bout going to the school nurse, if she feels there is the chance you may be sick, she will most likely recomend a trip to your doctor.

Perhaps your mom will not take you seriously the way you are going about it. If I were you I would write your mom a letter and explain in detail what you are going through and how you really feel. Sometimes putting it in writing is just what is needed to convince some people. I know it sounds funny, but I think you will find it will help. Good luck and hang in there!

Its important to understand that different individuals react differently to the same medication.  Somtimes the sexual side effects from an antidepressant are a good trade off with the overall benefits of the drug, sometimes not.  \"Stop getting off\" is a choice :-).  If your libido is comparatively low, you might not feel like indulging in sexual activity a lot, unless stimulated.  That again is a subjective thing.  Some men are prescribed antidepressants for premature ejaculation because it helps them to slow down and retain an erection for a longer time.\\n\\nAs far as weight is concerned, once you are \"off your butt\" you can do a lot to maintain that.  Dont expect the antidepressant to be a wonder drug but something that helps you \"for a while.\"\\n\\nThere are different kind of antidepressants -\\n\\n1.  Tricyclic antidepressants (Elavil, Endep, Anafranil, Norpramin, Pertofrane, Adapin, Sinequan, Tofranil, Aventyl, Vivactil, Surmontil)\\n\\n2.  Tetracyclic antidepressants (Asendin, Ludiomil).\\n\\n3.  SSRI antidepressants: Celexa, Prozac, Luvox, Paxil, Zoloft.\\n\\n4.  MAO inhibitors (Marplan, Nardil, Eldepryl, Parnate)\\n\\n5.  Serotonin antagonists (Serzone, Desyrel)\\n\\n6.  Others (Wellbutrin, Effexor, Remeron)\\n\\nMood stabilizers\\n\\nTegretol, Neurontin, Lamictal, Eskalith, Depakene, Depakote.\\n\\nThe most commonly used antidepressants are SSRIs with Prozac being considered almost a synonym for an antidepressant.\\n\\nWeight gain or loss and decreased or increased libido are not the only side effects of antidepressants.  There are other potentially dangerous side effects like muscular spasms and lethal interactions with other drugs that it makes it imperative to seek psychiatric consultation before you start on them.\\n\\nThe best treatment is a combination of cognitive therapy with an antidepressant.   Feeling Good by David D. Burns, M.D. is the Bible for depressed inviduals and psychiatrists themselves prescribe it to patients.  So go grab it first.  The latest version has a consumer guide for antidepressants as well.  Thats a great starting point!!!  Good luck.\\n\\nWould you be kind enough to rate the best answer?  I have worked hard on this question and am waiting for the results.  Thanks I think \"THAT\\'S RIGHT\" pretty much has this question answered.  I am on Paxil and Klonipin togrther and I did gain weight at first and blamed the meds, especially cuz I was a size 2/4.  I finally changed my eating habits, controlled cravings, got off my butt and exercised for the first time in my life and wa-lah!, didn\\'t lose all the weight, but am happy with being a 4/6, and I feel better about myself and am maintaining my weight.  As far as libido, your doc can help w/this one.  I thought I was having this problem too, just because all the info said I would.  I figured out that it was just a mind set, and I actually don\\'t have a prob w/this at all.  I don\\'t mean to downplay this, but it might be in your head.  Try telling yourself that your libido is awesome and see where it takes you! I agree with a few people Wellbutrin XL. I have tried paxil effexor respondol u name ive tried. this one works for me and it will help u stop smoking if you smoke -big +.  My sex drive is better than ever mostly cause im happier, but it won\\'t drive it down.  Talk to your doc though *GL* I am on Zoloft right now just in the second dose I think it is 20mg.  It is helping, and my sex drive is still a high as ever.  As for the weight part of it, I don\\'t think it matters, I think it is just a problem that I have and have to overcome on my own.\\n\\nGood Luck\\n\\nP.S. When I took Celexa, my sex drive got higher, I think I just about killed my boyfriend.  ;) Try going to a tanning booth for awhile first.  It helps with the winter blues, beleive it or not, but don\\'t over-do it, go too much and your tan will look fake. Try welbutrin. I was on Zoloft and hated feeling like a zombie and not being able to, ahem, finish. But if it has just been this winter you are sad, then I would suggest getting an artificial daylight lamp. Not sure where they are sold though. Hmm... Excercise increases energy, helps lose weight, and releases endorphins that actually increase your libido. Wellbutron has helped curb my food cravings, and no problems with the sex drive. Effexor and Zoloft added 30 lbs. lithium in terms of not gaining weight... not sure if it effects libifdo though. Been on many not currently on any but Wellbutrin made me lose weight and no effect on libido.  Except I would get uncontrollable rages so I had to stop so watch irritability.

I am 33 and have delt with this since the age of 13. Depression DOES cause physical symptoms.......good job knowing your own body.If your are under 18 and in school go to the school counselor.It is hard for those who are not depressed to understand but it is AN ABSOULTE MUST for u to get help...suicide happens often in untreated depressed teens.If your are not in school check google or call your local police startion {no need to give your name if u do not wish} for a local phone support line or if u are suicidal call an ambulance or go to your local hospitle.......you do not need your mothers permission to do so. PLEASE PLEASE pay attention to what your body is telling u. ALWAYS REMEMER THE SUN WILL COME OUT! Maybe not tomorrow but it will be back. When we are down it is very hard to remember that.....but if u hurt yourself there will never be a tomorrow. Talk to a counselor at school.  Tell them how you feel and ask them for help.  I'm very sure they will intervene on your behalf with your mom.\\n\\nIf they can't or won't, is there some reason you couldn't just go to your doctor on your own?  It's possible that it's nothing, but it's also possible that it's something.  I think you know how you feel.  It's time to do something about it.  Good luck. You don't have to convince anyone else of anything else, just convince yourself to call your doctor. Maybe your mom is right. Don't do anything suicidal to convince her she was wrong. Call the doctor! I would go to your mom and let her know that maybe it could be physical but either way you would like to find out, I would explain to the doctor how you have been feeling and that you are conserned that it is all tied in to depression, if your mom still isn't hearing you and won't take you to the doctors, how bout going to the school nurse, if she feels there is the chance you may be sick, she will most likely recomend a trip to your doctor. Good luck, don't give up, I would keep working at her, if you have a hard time talking with her why not write a letter, alot of times it is easier to say what we mean when we are not face to face. I don't think that you are depressed at all.It sounds like you are sick.What made you think that you are depressed?If you are really worried,as you should be,call the doctor your self.I don't think its normal to be sick if you are depressed.Call the doc, its better to be safe than sorry.good luck to you I suffer from depression also and I know what you are going through. Perhaps your mom will not take you seriously the way you are going about it. If I were you I would write your mom a letter and explain in detail what you are going through and how you really feel. Sometimes putting it in writing is just what is needed to convince some people. I know it sounds funny, but I think you will find it will help. Good luck and hang in there!

What should I do?\", 'answers': \"Persistent fatigue which is not alleviated by sleep is a characteristic of many chronic conditions. Debilitating fatigue can also occur without an obvious illness and, after six months, is classified as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Milder forms have been dubbed ‘TATT’ (tired all the time).\\n\\nFatigue can often be traced back to a viral infection, but this may not be the only culprit. It usually results from a combination of several factors, such as poor diet, overwork, a viral or bacterial infection, bereavement, stress, physical exhaustion, exposure to toxins etc. Its does not respond readily to modern drugs, so many sufferers turn towards alternative and complementary medicine in their quest for a solution.\\n\\nThe treatment strategy which has worked with my patients is to close all possible avenues where diet or lifestyle may be inadequate by using a multi-dimensional approach. This means making an effort to ensure an above-average nutrient-intake by eating a healthy diet coupled with taking a range of good-quality supplements. In addition, I prescribe herbal medicine with immune-stimulating properties. \\n\\nNutrition\\n\\nIt is especially important for people with fatigue to choose a healthy diet. However, even when eating in this way, a person with fatigue may not reach daily nutrient-intake targets because of poor absorption and poor appetite due to lack of exercise. Hence, nutrient supplementation is an important, essential strategy to augment a healthy diet. A supplement programme for fatigue should start with a basic ‘multi’. This will provide most of the vitamins and minerals needed by the body at essential requirement levels. However, it will not contain enough calcium and magnesium, because these are required in much higher quantities than will fit into a single ‘multi’. Extra calcium will be required if fewer than three portions of dairy products are eaten per day. More magnesium is required if the intake of wholegrains, nuts, beans and seeds is low. (In fact, magnesium deficiency is very common in fatigue.) It is best to take these two minerals together in a good bone formula in the ratio of 2:1 calcium to magnesium\\n\\nA group of symptoms often accompanying fatigue is related to inflammation. This shows up as catarrh, skin rash, dry skin or eadaches. There are two approaches to reduce inflammation: increasing intake of (a) antioxidants and (b) omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. Therefore, extra vitamin C is likely to be useful. For optimal nutrition, take at least 500mg daily as a supplement which, again, is much higher than will go into a single ‘multi’ tablet. \\n\\nI have written about the importance of getting the right balance of essential fatty acids in a previous Healthspan magazine.5 For fatigue sufferers, as well as having anti-inflammatory properties, it is the direct benefit that omega-3 fatty acids have on boosting normal immune function that is particularly important.\\n\\nHerbs\\n\\nFor those with CFS, herbal medicine seems to have a very special role in normalising the immune system, which cannot be effected by essential nutrients alone. In fact, the more severe and persistent the fatigue, the more important it seems to be to augment the nutritional approach above with immune-supportive herbs. Since herbal treatments for CFS have to be individually prescribed, a visit to a professional is necessary. Contact the College of Practitioners (01424 776780) or the National Institute of Medical Herbalists (01392 426022) to find a registered herbal practitioner in your area. Herbal prescriptions normally include those with outspoken traditional use for supporting the immune and nervous systems. St John’s Wort is particularly useful, since it appears to act in both domains. Echinacea, which can be used to help overcome exposure to viruses and to reduce the number of relapses, does not raise vitality in the same way. Other vitality-raising herbs for immune support include astragalus, ashwaganda This could be health related. Diabetics normally feel tired most of the time.

Vitamin deficiency for instance.  \\n\\nSee a doctor and have some basic bloodwork done, if you are not feeling better.\\n\\nYou CANNOT expect to get good advice from the people on ANSWERS. Even if a doctor answers your question, he is not intimate with your medical history, or you (on a professional level). \\n\\nFor example, I gave only one or two  possiblities.  \\n\\nSee a doctor, and find out for sure.  Why take chances with your body and life, asking questions here???\\n\\nI could give you the long answer you might find here, but realistically , you know your own body, and you need to make a decision to take your symptoms in hand.

What should I do?\", 'answers': \"Persistent fatigue which is not alleviated by sleep is a characteristic of many chronic conditions. Debilitating fatigue can also occur without an obvious illness and, after six months, is classified as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Milder forms have been dubbed ‘TATT’ (tired all the time).\\n\\nFatigue can often be traced back to a viral infection, but this may not be the only culprit. It usually results from a combination of several factors, such as poor diet, overwork, a viral or bacterial infection, bereavement, stress, physical exhaustion, exposure to toxins etc. Its does not respond readily to modern drugs, so many sufferers turn towards alternative and complementary medicine in their quest for a solution.\\n\\nThe treatment strategy which has worked with my patients is to close all possible avenues where diet or lifestyle may be inadequate by using a multi-dimensional approach. This means making an effort to ensure an above-average nutrient-intake by eating a healthy diet coupled with taking a range of good-quality supplements. In addition, I prescribe herbal medicine with immune-stimulating properties. \\n\\nNutrition\\n\\nIt is especially important for people with fatigue to choose a healthy diet. However, even when eating in this way, a person with fatigue may not reach daily nutrient-intake targets because of poor absorption and poor appetite due to lack of exercise. Hence, nutrient supplementation is an important, essential strategy to augment a healthy diet. A supplement programme for fatigue should start with a basic ‘multi’. This will provide most of the vitamins and minerals needed by the body at essential requirement levels. However, it will not contain enough calcium and magnesium, because these are required in much higher quantities than will fit into a single ‘multi’. Extra calcium will be required if fewer than three portions of dairy products are eaten per day. More magnesium is required if the intake of wholegrains, nuts, beans and seeds is low. (In fact, magnesium deficiency is very common in fatigue.) It is best to take these two minerals together in a good bone formula in the ratio of 2:1 calcium to magnesium\\n\\nA group of symptoms often accompanying fatigue is related to inflammation. This shows up as catarrh, skin rash, dry skin or eadaches. There are two approaches to reduce inflammation: increasing intake of (a) antioxidants and (b) omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. Therefore, extra vitamin C is likely to be useful. For optimal nutrition, take at least 500mg daily as a supplement which, again, is much higher than will go into a single ‘multi’ tablet. \\n\\nI have written about the importance of getting the right balance of essential fatty acids in a previous Healthspan magazine.5 For fatigue sufferers, as well as having anti-inflammatory properties, it is the direct benefit that omega-3 fatty acids have on boosting normal immune function that is particularly important.\\n\\nHerbs\\n\\nFor those with CFS, herbal medicine seems to have a very special role in normalising the immune system, which cannot be effected by essential nutrients alone. In fact, the more severe and persistent the fatigue, the more important it seems to be to augment the nutritional approach above with immune-supportive herbs. Since herbal treatments for CFS have to be individually prescribed, a visit to a professional is necessary. Contact the College of Practitioners (01424 776780) or the National Institute of Medical Herbalists (01392 426022) to find a registered herbal practitioner in your area. Herbal prescriptions normally include those with outspoken traditional use for supporting the immune and nervous systems. St John’s Wort is particularly useful, since it appears to act in both domains. Echinacea, which can be used to help overcome exposure to viruses and to reduce the number of relapses, does not raise vitality in the same way. Other vitality-raising herbs for immune support include astragalus, ashwaganda This could be health related. Diabetics normally feel tired most of the time. Please check with your doctor, it could be depression too. It could be a million different things from \\nMono, (Epstein-barr syndrome) or another term for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  Post viral fatigue syndrome, etc..\\nhttp://health.yahoo.com/ency/healthwise/hw168620\\n\\nCould be so many things. Vitamin deficiency for instance.  \\n\\nSee a doctor and have some basic bloodwork done, if you are not feeling better.\\n\\nYou CANNOT expect to get good advice from the people on ANSWERS. Even if a doctor answers your question, he is not intimate with your medical history, or you (on a professional level). \\n\\nFor example, I gave only one or two  possiblities.  \\n\\nSee a doctor, and find out for sure.

      "2025/01/13 13:24:50 ERROR dspy.utils.parallelizer: Error processing item Example({'question': 'Why is my hair falling out?', 'answers': \"Causes of Excessive Hair Loss\\n\\nThe rate of hair shedding in androgenic alopecia is speeded up by three forces: advancing age, an inherited tendency to bald early, and an over-abundance of the male hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) within the hair follicle. DHT is a highly active form of testosterone, which influences many aspects of manly behavior, from sex drive to aggression. \\n\\nThe conversion from testosterone to DHT is driven by an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase, which is produced in the prostate, various adrenal glands, and the scalp. Over time, the action of DHT causes the hair follicle to degrade and shortens the anagen phase. Thought the follicle is technically still alive and connected to a good blood supply--it can successfully nurture a transplanted follicle which is immune to the effects of DHT--it will grow smaller and smaller (figure 3). Some follicles will gradually die, but most will simply shrink to the size they were when you were born which produce weaker hairs. With a steadily shorter anagen growing cycle, more hairs are shed, the hairs becoming thinner and thinner until they are too fine to survive daily wear and tear. Balding hair gradually changes from long, thick, coarse, pigmented hair into fine, unpigmented vellus sprouts. \\n\\nHowever, the sebaceous gland attached to it remains the same size. As the hair shafts become smaller, the gland continues to pump out about the same amount of oil. So as your hair thins, you will notice that your hair becomes flatter and oilier. \\n\\nBut the hormonal link in balding is complex. Eunuchs, who produce no testosterone, never go bald -- even if carrying a baldness gene. However, if castrated men with a family history of baldness are given testosterone, they lose hair in the classic horseshoe-shaped pattern. \\n\\nStudies show that while balding men don't have higher than average circulating testosterone levels, they do possess above-average amounts of a powerful testosterone derivative, dihydrotestosterone in the scalp follicles. In male balding, genetically primed follicles convert circulating testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which successively diminishes or miniaturizes follicle size, producing ever weaker hairs. With a steadily shorter anagen growing cycle, more hairs are shed, the hairs becoming thinner and thinner until they are too fine to survive daily wear and tear. Balding hair gradually changes from long, thick, coarse, pigmented hair into fine, depigmented vellus sprouts. \\n\\nOther physiological factors might cause hair loss. Recently, a group of Japanese researcher reported a correlation between excessive sebum in the scalp and hair loss. Excessive sebum often accompanying thinning hair is attributed to an enlargement of the sebaceous gland. They believed excessive sebum causes an high level of 5-alpha reductase and pore clogging, thus malnutrition of the hair root. \\n\\nAlthough this condition could be hereditary, they believe diet is a more prominent cause. The researchers note that Japanese hair was thick and healthy, with a small gland and little scalp oil, until the occidental habit of consuming animal fat crept into their diet after World War II. This change has led to a significant height increase in the Japanese population, but it has also resulted in more Japanese men losing hair. To some extent, their observation makes sense since problems with greasy hair have often been noted as much as six months to a year prior to when thinning hair becomes noticeable, but this might be just one of the symptoms, not underlying cause, more research is needed. Most doctors agree that if you have a oily scalp with thinning hair, frequent shampooing is advised. shampooing can reduce surface sebum, which contains high levels of testosterone and DHT that may reenter the skin and affect the hair follicle. have blood test you could have a over or under active thyroid. because ur stressed. u should see a doc u could be sick .. very sick. did you recently have a baby?

Debilitating fatigue can also occur without an obvious illness and, after six months, is classified as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Milder forms have been dubbed ‘TATT’ (tired all the time).\\n\\nFatigue can often be traced back to a viral infection, but this may not be the only culprit. It usually results from a combination of several factors, such as poor diet, overwork, a viral or bacterial infection, bereavement, stress, physical exhaustion, exposure to toxins etc. Its does not respond readily to modern drugs, so many sufferers turn towards alternative and complementary medicine in their quest for a solution.\\n\\nThe treatment strategy which has worked with my patients is to close all possible avenues where diet or lifestyle may be inadequate by using a multi-dimensional approach. This means making an effort to ensure an above-average nutrient-intake by eating a healthy diet coupled with taking a range of good-quality supplements. In addition, I prescribe herbal medicine with immune-stimulating properties. \\n\\nNutrition\\n\\nIt is especially important for people with fatigue to choose a healthy diet. However, even when eating in this way, a person with fatigue may not reach daily nutrient-intake targets because of poor absorption and poor appetite due to lack of exercise. Hence, nutrient supplementation is an important, essential strategy to augment a healthy diet. A supplement programme for fatigue should start with a basic ‘multi’. This will provide most of the vitamins and minerals needed by the body at essential requirement levels. However, it will not contain enough calcium and magnesium, because these are required in much higher quantities than will fit into a single ‘multi’. Extra calcium will be required if fewer than three portions of dairy products are eaten per day. More magnesium is required if the intake of wholegrains, nuts, beans and seeds is low. (In fact, magnesium deficiency is very common in fatigue.) It is best to take these two minerals together in a good bone formula in the ratio of 2:1 calcium to magnesium\\n\\nA group of symptoms often accompanying fatigue is related to inflammation. This shows up as catarrh, skin rash, dry skin or eadaches. There are two approaches to reduce inflammation: increasing intake of (a) antioxidants and (b) omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. Therefore, extra vitamin C is likely to be useful. For optimal nutrition, take at least 500mg daily as a supplement which, again, is much higher than will go into a single ‘multi’ tablet. \\n\\nI have written about the importance of getting the right balance of essential fatty acids in a previous Healthspan magazine.5 For fatigue sufferers, as well as having anti-inflammatory properties, it is the direct benefit that omega-3 fatty acids have on boosting normal immune function that is particularly important.\\n\\nHerbs\\n\\nFor those with CFS, herbal medicine seems to have a very special role in normalising the immune system, which cannot be effected by essential nutrients alone. In fact, the more severe and persistent the fatigue, the more important it seems to be to augment the nutritional approach above with immune-supportive herbs. Since herbal treatments for CFS have to be individually prescribed, a visit to a professional is necessary. Contact the College of Practitioners (01424 776780) or the National Institute of Medical Herbalists (01392 426022) to find a registered herbal practitioner in your area. Herbal prescriptions normally include those with outspoken traditional use for supporting the immune and nervous systems. St John’s Wort is particularly useful, since it appears to act in both domains. Echinacea, which can be used to help overcome exposure to viruses and to reduce the number of relapses, does not raise vitality in the same way. Other vitality-raising herbs for immune support include astragalus, ashwaganda This could be health related. Diabetics normally feel tired most of the time. Please check with your doctor, it could be depression too. It could be a million different things from \\nMono, (Epstein-barr syndrome) or another term for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  Post viral fatigue syndrome, etc..\\nhttp://health.yahoo.com/ency/healthwise/hw168620\\n\\nCould be so many things. Vitamin deficiency for instance.  \\n\\nSee a doctor and have some basic bloodwork done, if you are not feeling better.\\n\\nYou CANNOT expect to get good advice from the people on ANSWERS. Even if a doctor answers your question, he is not intimate with your medical history, or you (on a professional level). \\n\\nFor example, I gave only one or two  possiblities.  \\n\\nSee a doctor, and find out for sure.  Why take chances with your body and life, asking questions here???\\n\\nI could give you the long answer you might find here, but realistically , you know your own body, and you need to make a decision to take your symptoms in hand.  If it doesn't change after a few lifestyle changes, diet, rest, etc..  Get to the doc. you mite have a thyroid condition! ask your doctor A week is not enough---stay regular and get exercise.

Extra calcium will be required if fewer than three portions of dairy products are eaten per day. More magnesium is required if the intake of wholegrains, nuts, beans and seeds is low. (In fact, magnesium deficiency is very common in fatigue.) It is best to take these two minerals together in a good bone formula in the ratio of 2:1 calcium to magnesium\\n\\nA group of symptoms often accompanying fatigue is related to inflammation. This shows up as catarrh, skin rash, dry skin or eadaches. There are two approaches to reduce inflammation: increasing intake of (a) antioxidants and (b) omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. Therefore, extra vitamin C is likely to be useful. For optimal nutrition, take at least 500mg daily as a supplement which, again, is much higher than will go into a single ‘multi’ tablet. \\n\\nI have written about the importance of getting the right balance of essential fatty acids in a previous Healthspan magazine.5 For fatigue sufferers, as well as having anti-inflammatory properties, it is the direct benefit that omega-3 fatty acids have on boosting normal immune function that is particularly important.\\n\\nHerbs\\n\\nFor those with CFS, herbal medicine seems to have a very special role in normalising the immune system, which cannot be effected by essential nutrients alone. In fact, the more severe and persistent the fatigue, the more important it seems to be to augment the nutritional approach above with immune-supportive herbs. Since herbal treatments for CFS have to be individually prescribed, a visit to a professional is necessary. Contact the College of Practitioners (01424 776780) or the National Institute of Medical Herbalists (01392 426022) to find a registered herbal practitioner in your area. Herbal prescriptions normally include those with outspoken traditional use for supporting the immune and nervous systems. St John’s Wort is particularly useful, since it appears to act in both domains.

What should I do?\", 'answers': \"Persistent fatigue which is not alleviated by sleep is a characteristic of many chronic conditions. Debilitating fatigue can also occur without an obvious illness and, after six months, is classified as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Milder forms have been dubbed ‘TATT’ (tired all the time).\\n\\nFatigue can often be traced back to a viral infection, but this may not be the only culprit. It usually results from a combination of several factors, such as poor diet, overwork, a viral or bacterial infection, bereavement, stress, physical exhaustion, exposure to toxins etc. Its does not respond readily to modern drugs, so many sufferers turn towards alternative and complementary medicine in their quest for a solution.\\n\\nThe treatment strategy which has worked with my patients is to close all possible avenues where diet or lifestyle may be inadequate by using a multi-dimensional approach. This means making an effort to ensure an above-average nutrient-intake by eating a healthy diet coupled with taking a range of good-quality supplements. In addition, I prescribe herbal medicine with immune-stimulating properties. \\n\\nNutrition\\n\\nIt is especially important for people with fatigue to choose a healthy diet. However, even when eating in this way, a person with fatigue may not reach daily nutrient-intake targets because of poor absorption and poor appetite due to lack of exercise. Hence, nutrient supplementation is an important, essential strategy to augment a healthy diet. A supplement programme for fatigue should start with a basic ‘multi’.

Its important to understand that different individuals react differently to the same medication.  Somtimes the sexual side effects from an antidepressant are a good trade off with the overall benefits of the drug, sometimes not.  \"Stop getting off\" is a choice :-).  If your libido is comparatively low, you might not feel like indulging in sexual activity a lot, unless stimulated.  That again is a subjective thing.  Some men are prescribed antidepressants for premature ejaculation because it helps them to slow down and retain an erection for a longer time.\\n\\nAs far as weight is concerned, once you are \"off your butt\" you can do a lot to maintain that.  Dont expect the antidepressant to be a wonder drug but something that helps you \"for a while.\"\\n\\nThere are different kind of antidepressants -\\n\\n1.  Tricyclic antidepressants (Elavil, Endep, Anafranil, Norpramin, Pertofrane, Adapin, Sinequan, Tofranil, Aventyl, Vivactil, Surmontil)\\n\\n2.  Tetracyclic antidepressants (Asendin, Ludiomil).\\n\\n3.  SSRI antidepressants: Celexa, Prozac, Luvox, Paxil, Zoloft.\\n\\n4.  MAO inhibitors (Marplan, Nardil, Eldepryl, Parnate)\\n\\n5.  Serotonin antagonists (Serzone, Desyrel)\\n\\n6.  Others (Wellbutrin, Effexor, Remeron)\\n\\nMood stabilizers\\n\\nTegretol, Neurontin, Lamictal, Eskalith, Depakene, Depakote.\\n\\nThe most commonly used antidepressants are SSRIs with Prozac being considered almost a synonym for an antidepressant.\\n\\nWeight gain or loss and decreased or increased libido are not the only side effects of antidepressants.  There are other potentially dangerous side effects like muscular spasms and lethal interactions with other drugs that it makes it imperative to seek psychiatric consultation before you start on them.\\n\\nThe best treatment is a combination of cognitive therapy with an antidepressant.   Feeling Good by David D. Burns, M.D. is the Bible for depressed inviduals and psychiatrists themselves prescribe it to patients.  So go grab it first.  The latest version has a consumer guide for antidepressants as well.  Thats a great starting point!!!  Good luck.\\n\\nWould you be kind enough to rate the best answer?  I have worked hard on this question and am waiting for the results.  Thanks I think \"THAT\\'S RIGHT\" pretty much has this question answered.  I am on Paxil and Klonipin togrther and I did gain weight at first and blamed the meds, especially cuz I was a size 2/4.  I finally changed my eating habits, controlled cravings, got off my butt and exercised for the first time in my life and wa-lah!, didn\\'t lose all the weight, but am happy with being a 4/6, and I feel better about myself and am maintaining my weight.  As far as libido, your doc can help w/this one.  I thought I was having this problem too, just because all the info said I would.  I figured out that it was just a mind set, and I actually don\\'t have a prob w/this at all.  I don\\'t mean to downplay this, but it might be in your head.  Try telling yourself that your libido is awesome and see where it takes you! I agree with a few people Wellbutrin XL. I have tried paxil effexor respondol u name ive tried. this one works for me and it will help u stop smoking if you smoke -big +.  My sex drive is better than ever mostly cause im happier, but it won\\'t drive it down.  Talk to your doc though *GL* I am on Zoloft right now just in the second dose I think it is 20mg.  It is helping, and my sex drive is still a high as ever.  As for the weight part of it, I don\\'t think it matters, I think it is just a problem that I have and have to overcome on my own.\\n\\nGood Luck\\n\\nP.S. When I took Celexa, my sex drive got higher, I think I just about killed my boyfriend.  ;) Try going to a tanning booth for awhile first.  It helps with the winter blues, beleive it or not, but don\\'t over-do it, go too much and your tan will look fake. Try welbutrin. I was on Zoloft and hated feeling like a zombie and not being able to, ahem, finish. But if it has just been this winter you are sad, then I would suggest getting an artificial daylight lamp. Not sure where they are sold though. Hmm... Excercise increases energy, helps lose weight, and releases endorphins that actually increase your libido. Wellbutron has helped curb my food cravings, and no problems with the sex drive. Effexor and Zoloft added 30 lbs. lithium in terms of not gaining weight... not sure if it effects libifdo though. Been on many not currently on any but Wellbutrin made me lose weight and no effect on libido.  Except I would get uncontrollable rages so I had to stop so watch irritability.

What should I do?\", 'answers': \"Persistent fatigue which is not alleviated by sleep is a characteristic of many chronic conditions. Debilitating fatigue can also occur without an obvious illness and, after six months, is classified as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Milder forms have been dubbed ‘TATT’ (tired all the time).\\n\\nFatigue can often be traced back to a viral infection, but this may not be the only culprit. It usually results from a combination of several factors, such as poor diet, overwork, a viral or bacterial infection, bereavement, stress, physical exhaustion, exposure to toxins etc. Its does not respond readily to modern drugs, so many sufferers turn towards alternative and complementary medicine in their quest for a solution.\\n\\nThe treatment strategy which has worked with my patients is to close all possible avenues where diet or lifestyle may be inadequate by using a multi-dimensional approach. This means making an effort to ensure an above-average nutrient-intake by eating a healthy diet coupled with taking a range of good-quality supplements. In addition, I prescribe herbal medicine with immune-stimulating properties. \\n\\nNutrition\\n\\nIt is especially important for people with fatigue to choose a healthy diet. However, even when eating in this way, a person with fatigue may not reach daily nutrient-intake targets because of poor absorption and poor appetite due to lack of exercise. Hence, nutrient supplementation is an important, essential strategy to augment a healthy diet. A supplement programme for fatigue should start with a basic ‘multi’. This will provide most of the vitamins and minerals needed by the body at essential requirement levels. However, it will not contain enough calcium and magnesium, because these are required in much higher quantities than will fit into a single ‘multi’. Extra calcium will be required if fewer than three portions of dairy products are eaten per day. More magnesium is required if the intake of wholegrains, nuts, beans and seeds is low. (In fact, magnesium deficiency is very common in fatigue.) It is best to take these two minerals together in a good bone formula in the ratio of 2:1 calcium to magnesium\\n\\nA group of symptoms often accompanying fatigue is related to inflammation. This shows up as catarrh, skin rash, dry skin or eadaches. There are two approaches to reduce inflammation: increasing intake of (a) antioxidants and (b) omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. Therefore, extra vitamin C is likely to be useful. For optimal nutrition, take at least 500mg daily as a supplement which, again, is much higher than will go into a single ‘multi’ tablet. \\n\\nI have written about the importance of getting the right balance of essential fatty acids in a previous Healthspan magazine.5 For fatigue sufferers, as well as having anti-inflammatory properties, it is the direct benefit that omega-3 fatty acids have on boosting normal immune function that is particularly important.\\n\\nHerbs\\n\\nFor those with CFS, herbal medicine seems to have a very special role in normalising the immune system, which cannot be effected by essential nutrients alone. In fact, the more severe and persistent the fatigue, the more important it seems to be to augment the nutritional approach above with immune-supportive herbs. Since herbal treatments for CFS have to be individually prescribed, a visit to a professional is necessary. Contact the College of Practitioners (01424 776780) or the National Institute of Medical Herbalists (01392 426022) to find a registered herbal practitioner in your area. Herbal prescriptions normally include those with outspoken traditional use for supporting the immune and nervous systems. St John’s Wort is particularly useful, since it appears to act in both domains. Echinacea, which can be used to help overcome exposure to viruses and to reduce the number of relapses, does not raise vitality in the same way. Other vitality-raising herbs for immune support include astragalus, ashwaganda This could be health related. Diabetics normally feel tired most of the time. Please check with your doctor, it could be depression too. It could be a million different things from \\nMono, (Epstein-barr syndrome) or another term for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  Post viral fatigue syndrome, etc..\\nhttp://health.yahoo.com/ency/healthwise/hw168620\\n\\nCould be so many things. Vitamin deficiency for instance.  \\n\\nSee a doctor and have some basic bloodwork done, if you are not feeling better.\\n\\nYou CANNOT expect to get good advice from the people on ANSWERS. Even if a doctor answers your question, he is not intimate with your medical history, or you (on a professional level). \\n\\nFor example, I gave only one or two  possiblities.  \\n\\nSee a doctor, and find out for sure.  Why take chances with your body and life, asking questions here???\\n\\nI could give you the long answer you might find here, but realistically , you know your own body, and you need to make a decision to take your symptoms in hand.

What should I do?\", 'answers': \"Persistent fatigue which is not alleviated by sleep is a characteristic of many chronic conditions. Debilitating fatigue can also occur without an obvious illness and, after six months, is classified as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Milder forms have been dubbed ‘TATT’ (tired all the time).\\n\\nFatigue can often be traced back to a viral infection, but this may not be the only culprit. It usually results from a combination of several factors, such as poor diet, overwork, a viral or bacterial infection, bereavement, stress, physical exhaustion, exposure to toxins etc. Its does not respond readily to modern drugs, so many sufferers turn towards alternative and complementary medicine in their quest for a solution.\\n\\nThe treatment strategy which has worked with my patients is to close all possible avenues where diet or lifestyle may be inadequate by using a multi-dimensional approach. This means making an effort to ensure an above-average nutrient-intake by eating a healthy diet coupled with taking a range of good-quality supplements. In addition, I prescribe herbal medicine with immune-stimulating properties. \\n\\nNutrition\\n\\nIt is especially important for people with fatigue to choose a healthy diet. However, even when eating in this way, a person with fatigue may not reach daily nutrient-intake targets because of poor absorption and poor appetite due to lack of exercise. Hence, nutrient supplementation is an important, essential strategy to augment a healthy diet. A supplement programme for fatigue should start with a basic ‘multi’. This will provide most of the vitamins and minerals needed by the body at essential requirement levels. However, it will not contain enough calcium and magnesium, because these are required in much higher quantities than will fit into a single ‘multi’. Extra calcium will be required if fewer than three portions of dairy products are eaten per day. More magnesium is required if the intake of wholegrains, nuts, beans and seeds is low. (In fact, magnesium deficiency is very common in fatigue.) It is best to take these two minerals together in a good bone formula in the ratio of 2:1 calcium to magnesium\\n\\nA group of symptoms often accompanying fatigue is related to inflammation. This shows up as catarrh, skin rash, dry skin or eadaches. There are two approaches to reduce inflammation: increasing intake of (a) antioxidants and (b) omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. Therefore, extra vitamin C is likely to be useful. For optimal nutrition, take at least 500mg daily as a supplement which, again, is much higher than will go into a single ‘multi’ tablet. \\n\\nI have written about the importance of getting the right balance of essential fatty acids in a previous Healthspan magazine.5 For fatigue sufferers, as well as having anti-inflammatory properties, it is the direct benefit that omega-3 fatty acids have on boosting normal immune function that is particularly important.\\n\\nHerbs\\n\\nFor those with CFS, herbal medicine seems to have a very special role in normalising the immune system, which cannot be effected by essential nutrients alone. In fact, the more severe and persistent the fatigue, the more important it seems to be to augment the nutritional approach above with immune-supportive herbs. Since herbal treatments for CFS have to be individually prescribed, a visit to a professional is necessary. Contact the College of Practitioners (01424 776780) or the National Institute of Medical Herbalists (01392 426022) to find a registered herbal practitioner in your area. Herbal prescriptions normally include those with outspoken traditional use for supporting the immune and nervous systems. St John’s Wort is particularly useful, since it appears to act in both domains. Echinacea, which can be used to help overcome exposure to viruses and to reduce the number of relapses, does not raise vitality in the same way. Other vitality-raising herbs for immune support include astragalus, ashwaganda This could be health related. Diabetics normally feel tired most of the time. Please check with your doctor, it could be depression too. It could be a million different things from \\nMono, (Epstein-barr syndrome) or another term for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  Post viral fatigue syndrome, etc..\\nhttp://health.yahoo.com/ency/healthwise/hw168620\\n\\nCould be so many things. Vitamin deficiency for instance.  \\n\\nSee a doctor and have some basic bloodwork done, if you are not feeling better.\\n\\nYou CANNOT expect to get good advice from the people on ANSWERS. Even if a doctor answers your question, he is not intimate with your medical history, or you (on a professional level). \\n\\nFor example, I gave only one or two  possiblities.  \\n\\nSee a doctor, and find out for sure.  Why take chances with your body and life, asking questions here???\\n\\nI could give you the long answer you might find here, but realistically , you know your own body, and you need to make a decision to take your symptoms in hand.  If it doesn't change after a few lifestyle changes, diet, rest, etc..  Get to the doc. you mite have a thyroid condition! ask your doctor A week is not enough---stay regular and get exercise. Avoid eating before bed. Do you snore?  I snored and was tired all the time no matter how much sleep I was getting so I had a sleep study and found out that I have sleep anpea.  Now with my CPAP, I feel better than ever. I am 60 years old and fought sleep apnea for at least 40 of them!  You sleep but there is not quality sleep. You are asleep and do not realize that you are not maybe breathing regularily.  The brain does not go into REM true sleep.  It took a visit to a sleep clinic following the pushing of my family. Check with your family doctor.  It gave me back about 20 years!!\\n\\nI literally feel younger and much better each and every morning, I fought it though, honestly with every thing inside me,I am hard headed and self sufficient.
